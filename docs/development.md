## Development
If youâ€™d like to contribute and hack on the imdby project, feel free to clone a development version of this repository locally:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/santhoshse7en/imdby.git
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your Python package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python setup.py install
```

Feel free to give our testing suite a shot:

```bash
$ python imdby/imdb.py
```
